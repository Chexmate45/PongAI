You will need python installed, numpy and pygame installed.

If you don't have numpy installed, in terminal type 'pip install numpy'.

If you don't have pygame installed, in terminal type 'pip install pygame'.

When that is done run the command 'python main.py' then watch the magic begin

Worked on this for a while, please don't give hate if it is bad. After all it is open-source!
